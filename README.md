# Lending Club: Predicting Loan Defaulters
LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

The project is a part of the Jose Portilla's Data Science Bootcamp [course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaUB0MdcFdXRXQ=/). The project has been performed using deep learning library TensorFlow.

* Performed the exploratory data analysis
* Performed data preprocessing (coping with missing data, transforming categorical data, train-test split, and data normalizing)
* Engineered features from the existing variables
* Created and evaluated the model built using TensorFlow
* Checked an exising entry from the dataset against the model 

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow  
**Data set:** https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club.

## The Goal
Based on the historical data provided in the dataset, a model is to be built that will predict if the borrower will fully pay the loan or will default on it (so the loan will be charged-off). The model will allow to predict if a new potential customer is likely to pay back the loan.
